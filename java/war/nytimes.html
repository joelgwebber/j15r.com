    <p>NEW DELHI &#151; The ruling Indian National Congress was poised Saturday to soar to a surprisingly decisive victory in <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/india/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about India.">India</a>&#8217;s parliamentary elections, sidelining small, regional party bosses and potentially diminishing the power of communists who had been largely responsible for blocking economic reforms over the last five years.</p>

 <p>With the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party conceding defeat by early afternoon, the apparent Congress landslide signals the possibility of a stable and strong government in the face of stiff challenges: a sharp slowdown in economic growth, abiding poverty and instability in the region, including in Pakistan.</p><p>By midafternoon, the Congress-led coalition was projected to be leading in 248 of 543 parliamentary seats, according to the state-owned television broadcaster, Doordarshan, with 162 for the coalition headed by the opposition B.J.P. A third alliance, launched by a collection of communist parties, reported a lead in only 60 seats. Final results were due later in the day.</p><p>&#8220;We have got the numbers now to form a stable government,&#8221; Prithviraj Chavan, a Congress minister, declared on television. A smaller vote share would have led to protracted and difficult political horse-trading with necessary allies and engendered a potentially weak and ineffectual government &#151; a prospect that had worried political observers at home and analysts and investors abroad.</p><p>The incumbent Prime Minister <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/manmohan_singh/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Manmohan Singh.">Manmohan Singh</a> was expected to continue in office. Not since the country&#8217;s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has an incumbent prime minister finished a full five year term in office and been returned to power.</p><p>Congress&#8217;s appeals to the rural poor paid off, including a massive public jobs program in the countryside, higher government prices for staple grains, and a costly loan waiver program for indebted farmers. A host of regional and caste-based parties, whose leaders had openly declared their ambitions to rule India, trailed. And in the massive, politically influential state of Uttar Pradesh, with a population equivalent to that of Brazil, Congress posted its best performance in over 20 years.</p><p>For this, Congress leaders showered praise on Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the inevitable party leader; he and his sister, Priyanka Vadra, known for her quick political wit, campaigned heavily across the state.</p><p>The apparent margin of victory surprised even party officials.</p><p>&#8220;It exceeded our wildest expectations,&#8221; Jairam Ramesh, a key Congress party strategist, said in an interview in the party headquarters, as party workers beat drums and set of firecrackers in the sizzling midday heat.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, at a somber and largely empty B.J.P. office, Arun Jaitley, a party leader, accepted defeat. &#8220;Something certainly did go wrong,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;We will analyze the reasons.&#8221;</p><p>Congress will still need a few outside partners to seize a majority of parliament, and none among its leaders were ready to announce their choice of allies. Last time, the Congress-led coalition, known as the United Progressive Alliance, relied on several Communist parties to stay in power, and the government was frequently bogged down by the competing demands of its partners, putting a slate of reforms on hold, from fixing the bureaucracy to privatizing more state-owned companies. The Communists withdrew their support over the contentious and path-breathing nuclear deal with the United States last October.</p><p>This time, the Communists seem to have got a drubbing in their longtime stronghold state of West Bengal &#151; paradoxically, over the way its investor-friendly leaders tried to forcibly acquire farmland for industry.</p><p>For Congress, this stands to bring sweet relief. &#8220;The Left will not have a stranglehold,&#8221; said Mr. Ramesh. &#8220;There will be better cohesion on economic policy. Right now, the priority is to restore high economic growth.&#8221;</p><p>The B.J.P.&#8217;s appeals to national security did not yield political dividends. Its b&#234;te noire, Varun Gandhi, jailed for making hate speeches, was projected to win.</p><p>The election results defied several commonplace assumptions. Several professional commentators rued the absence of ideas and ideology in these polls, and yet Indians went to the polls in droves in the scorching summer heat: At nearly 60 percent, election turnout was higher than in 2004. There were widespread fears about small, regional parties upstaging the national parties &#151; or demanding influential government portfolios in exchange for their support. But they remained small and regional, and some of them approached defeat.</p><p>For Rahul Gandhi, these elections were a crucial test of credibility. Mr. Gandhi became his party&#8217;s star campaigner, averaging four campaign rallies a day for over a month straight. His mother, the party chairperson, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/sonia_gandhi/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Sonia Gandhi.">Sonia Gandhi</a>, had renounced the prime minister&#8217;s post last time, when the Congress clinched a surprise victory. This time, too, she faces an act of renunciation: whether to stick to Mr. Singh, whom she has repeatedly described as the party&#8217;s choice for the post, or rewarding her son.</p><NYT_AUTHOR_ID><div id="authorId"><p>Hari Kumar contributed reporting for this article.</p></div></NYT_AUTHOR_ID><NYT_UPDATE_BOTTOM>
