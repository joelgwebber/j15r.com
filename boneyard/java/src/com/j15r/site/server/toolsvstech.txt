Tools vs. Technology
--------------------

Tools:
- Make your job easier
- Should be invisible to users

Technology:
- Make new things possible
- Can reasonably require deployment (though still better if they don't)

Java:
- Tool masquerading as technology.
- Why did it fail on the desktop?
  - User: What does this do for me exactly?
