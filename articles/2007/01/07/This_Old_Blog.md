This Old Blog

I think I may have broken the 'longest period of time between two blog posts'
record, at roughly two years. The few people who remember it will probably be
asking themselves, 'what the hell happened to it, anyway?'

Well, you may not be terribly surprised to learn that I took a job at Google,
and have been incredibly busy in the intervening time, working on the Google
Web Toolkit. Initially, I tried to keep up with the blog and related flood of
random email, but it got to be a bit more than I had time to deal with, so I
just decided to nuke it so I could concentrate. This worked, of course, but
seemed to irritate a few people who saw a little value in some of the posts.

Now that I've got a little more time, I've decided to resurrect it. I kept
copies of the old articles around, some of which I've re-posted. I apologize
for the loss of the old comments -- some of them were really helpful, but
they're really a pain to get back into Blogger (maybe I'll find a way to do
this easily sometime).

I do plan on covering largely the same subjects, and please feel free to email
me with questions or subjects you'd like me to cover.
