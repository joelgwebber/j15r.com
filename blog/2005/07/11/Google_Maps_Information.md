Google Maps Information

I've been getting a slow but steady stream of requests for more information on
how to work with Google Maps. I would love to respond to each of these
individually, but honestly haven't been doing much with it since I wrote my
first few articles on the subject. Fortunately, I just ran across the Google
Maps Mania blog. It seems to be doing a pretty good job of aggregating all of
the stuff going on with Maps at the moment. I'm really quite amazed at the
array of different things people are building with it (and I doubt there's any
way I could keep up with it all anyway). Happy mapping to all!
