HTML is the Next Silverlight
----------------------------

In the past several years, there's been a real split between those who proclaim
that DHTML and Ajax are the platform of the future, and those who believe that
it's a teetering pile of crap that has to be burned down so we can finally *do
it right*.

The latter camp has created a range of alternatives, the two most viable
examples of which are Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight (or WPF/E or .NET or
whatever they're calling it this week). Flash has been around in one form or
another for ages, Silverlight is new, and a few years back there was a short-
lived proliferation of browser plugins that were supposed to "fix" the web.

[TODO: refs]

Back to the former camp. Many of this crowd seem to believe that there's
nothing wrong with the web just as it is, if everyone would *just implement the
standards* as they're specified. Not surprisingly, Internet Explorer is always
called out as the main culprit (To be fair to Microsoft, it should be pointed
out that at the time it was released, Internet Explorer 6 was clearly the best
browser in existence, both in features and in stability. The real problem is
that they appear to have stopped all substantive work at that point; IE7 didn't
change anything fundamental. It seems that they might be making a lot of big,
positive changes [TODO: ref] with IE8, though the jury's still out on that.)

What are we actually trying to achieve here?

It's a bit odd, but I seldom see anyone actually articulating goals here.
There's a lot of hand-waving about a "richer experience" and "ease of
development", but little in the way of hard goals.
